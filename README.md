- Welcome to FitPod! Our Wellness Sprints are focused, time-bound research projects where experts, brands, and enthusiasts collaborate to distill scientific findings into practical tools for wellness. Each sprint tackles a specific area of metabolic health, such as blood sugar regulation or personalized nutrition, with the goal of developing accessible, evidence-based recommendations and resources.
